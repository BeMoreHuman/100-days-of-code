# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Mahjong-like-game app.

**Thoughts:** Implement logic and UI.
- The objective of the game is to collect cards until no card is hidden. User picks a card and if its value matches the value of a previous selected card, both cards change state to “visible”.
- Any card can have a value in [1,99] range. 
- No two pairs with identical values are allowed.
